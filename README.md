# Box
This is a game I am currently making in C++ using SDL. I'm doing this to learn more C++ and because I enjoy making games.

## Current state of the game

The box can be moved with the arrow keys. The box cant move outside the window.

### Things I'd like to add
- [ ] An objective!
- [ ] A title screen
- [ ] Save files
